### Features Added Since Last Update
- Added more basic placeholders
- Created the script for character follow using my own camera measurements.
- Added the jumping code
- Added character facing direction determined by walking back or forth.
- Created simple level 1 proto-type.

### Issues Encountered
- When I wanted my character(Oswaldo) to jump on top of the block but he just fell through I wondered what I could do. But then I remembered all I needed to do was simply add a 2D collider within the inspector to enable him to step on top! 
- I also noticed that this repo claims I have written my code in HTML even though I haven't? So I am not sure why even though my scripts end in cs demonstrating I have written it in C#?

### Lessons Learned
- It is important to constantly keep resetting/updating my script(s) in unity after changing even the smallest thing. Even if it resets itself, just to be sure  it is running properly.

### Features Added Since Last Update
- Fixed my player to now be able to properly make contact with the floor.
- Created a new player script for better movement. 
- Added enemy script
- Moved code over from Visual Studios to Visual Studios Code for the use of Intellisense. As well as to learn how to use VS code. 

### Issues Encountered
- My player's box still not checking off when he hits the ground. (Fixed now)
- Animations not properly switching off when they need to. 

### Lessons Learned
- Intellisense is a very useful tool that assists in making the development code process of the game much more simple.
- Using AI is a very helpful tool to turn to when questioning why your code may not be functioning. Just make sure NOT TO always believe what it says. it may take you down a rabbit hole and break everything.

### Features Added Since Last Update
- Since my game is Mario based, my goombas are symbols of the IRS.. because.. who likes the IRS!?!?
- Added in background music as well as some basic sound effects
- Implemented scene switching for my character to go from level 1 to 2 to 3!
- Worked on my full design for level 1 as well as 2.
- Designed some simple elements such as bushes, loading in screen, dying screen, completion screens, and some buttons! (Will work on implementing in next week!)

### Issues Encountered
- Being intimidated by how good everyone else's game is. Everyone is doing so good!!!!
- As for background features in my game such as designs like hills and bushes my character was sometimes going in front and sometimes going behind them so I fixed that so he only goes in front of them! (With the help of Mr.Cram thank you!)
- My character's rigidbody was causing him to collide oddly with blocks when jumping so I made it smaller to suit him better! (With the help of Mr.Cram thank you!)

### Lessons Learned
- Asking questions is ALWAYS! The right answer!

### Features Added Since Last Update
- I redesigned my levels 1 and 2 because after finishing my design for level 3 I realized I didn't like how simple they looked compared to level 3!
- Created Mushroom design for mystery block. I didn't realize the mystery block had to be a prehab so I'm glad I learned that!
- (Thanks to Mr.Cram!) I got the main menu screen working! Yay!
- I also finally got the jumping animation to work. I didn't realize I had to split my animation into 2, ascending and descending, but after doing it it makes so much sense why!
- Worked on laying out the background scenery for all 3 of my levels to make them look at pretty as possible!
- I also created cloud animations and got them to work on a loop, and they look so cute!!
  
### Issues Encountered
- I did for the first time encounter some canvas laying over issues in Unity, but I didn't realize it was called rendering until I looked up my issue and finally got my layers sorted out!

### Lessons Learned
- Procrastinating, is NOT FUN!!!! I am so glad I always do ask a lot of questions though because if I didn't ask ANY, I would not be even HALF WAY of where I am now! (Thank you so much for always answering them Mr.Cram I appreciate you so much!)
