### Features Added Since Last Update
- Added more basic placeholders
- Created the script for character follow using my own camera measurements.
- Added the jumping code
- Added character facing direction determined by walking back or forth.
- Created simple level 1 proto-type.

### Issues Encountered
- When I wanted my character(Oswaldo) to jump on top of the block but he just fell through I wondered what I could do. But then I remembered all I needed to do was simply add a 2D collider within the inspector to enable him to step on top! 
- I also noticed that this repo claims I have written my code in HTML even though I haven't? So I am not sure why even though my scripts end in cs demonstrating I have written it in C#?

### Lessons Learned
- It is important to constantly keep resetting/updating my script(s) in unity after changing even the smallest thing. Even if it resets itself, just to be sure  it is running properly.

- Fixed my player to now be able to properly make contact with the floor.
- Created a new player script for better movement. 
- Added enemy script
- Moved code over from Visual Studios to Visual Studios Code for the use of Intellisense. As well as to learn how to use VS code. 

### Issues Encountered
- My player's box still not checking off when he hits the ground. (Fixed now)
- Animations not properly switching off when they need to. 

### Lessons Learned
- Intellisense is a very useful tool that assists in making the development code process of the game much more simple.
- Using AI is a very helpful tool to turn to when questioning why your code may not be functioning. Just make sure NOT TO always believe what it says. it may take you down a rabbit hole and break everything.
