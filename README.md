### Features Added Since Last Update
- Added more basic placeholders
- Created the script for character follow using my own camera measurements.
- Added the jumping code
- Added character facing direction determined by walking back or forth.
- Created simple level 1 proto-type.

### Issues Encountered
- When I wanted my character(Oswaldo) to jump on top of the block but he just fell through I wondered what I could do. But then I remembered all I needed to do was simply add a 2D collider within the inspector to enable him to step on top! 
- I also noticed that this repo claims I have written my code in HTML even though I haven't? So I am not sure why even though my scripts end in cs demonstrating I have written it in C#?

### Lessons Learned
- It is important to constantly keep resetting/updating my script(s) in unity after changing even the smallest thing. Even if it resets itself, just to be sure  it is running properly.
